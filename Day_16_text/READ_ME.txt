Callback: 
      A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function that executes the callback based on the result. 
      They are basically functions that are executed only after a result is produced. 
      Callbacks are an important part of asynchronous JavaScript.


The setTimeout() method calls a function after a number of milliseconds.
      1 second = 1000 milliseconds.
      Ex: const myTimeout = setTimeout(myGreeting, 5000);
