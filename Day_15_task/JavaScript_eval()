eval() in javascript:
eval() is a built-in function in JavaScript that allows you to evaluate a string of JavaScript code as if it were a part of the current code being executed.
It takes a string as an argument and executes it as JavaScript code, returning the result of the execution.
Here's the syntax for eval(): eval(string)
The eval() method evaluates or executes an argument.
If the argument is an expression, eval() evaluates the expression. If the argument is one or more JavaScript statements, eval() executes the statements.

evel () Limitation:
Executing JavaScript from a string is an BIG security risk.
With eval(), malicious code can run inside your application without permission.
With eval(), third-party code can see the scope of your application, which can lead to possible attacks.
